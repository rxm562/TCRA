TCRA is a Python package designed to perform scenario-based tropical cyclone risk analysis. The software includes capability to:

1. Scenario-hazard estimation: peak gust wind speed at sites
2. Vulnerability analysis using fragility curves
3. Damage Simulation using peak gust wind and fragility curves of structures
4. Monte Carlo Simulation is performed for estimating probability of failure
5. Interactive outputs plotting on openstreetmap
