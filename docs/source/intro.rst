**Tropical Cyclone Risk Analysis [TCRA]** is a Python package that allows developing scenario-based tropical cyclone risk analysis of buildings and electrical network system. This tool allows to perform hazard analysis based on historical cyclone track, damage analysis given the intensity estimated through scenario cyclone track, monte-carlo simulation for prioritizing the damaged structures for rehabilitaiton, and recovery simulation.
